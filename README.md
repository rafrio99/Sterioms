Frontend Project Setup Guide: Welcome to the frontend project! This guide will walk you through setting up your development environment, from installing dependencies to running the project.

Prerequisites: Ensure you have the following software installed on your machine before proceeding.

1. Node.js
Download and install Node.js from the official website: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).
To verify if Node.js is installed, run the following command in your terminal: `node -v`
This should return the version number of Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Git
Download and install Git from the official website: [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
To verify if Git is installed, run: `git --version`
This should return the version number of Git installed on your machine.

Project Setup: Once you have Node.js and Git installed, follow the steps below to set up the project.

1. Clone the Project
First, clone the project repository from GitHub using Git: `git clone https://github.com/sdt-grp-two-uestc/frontend.git`
2. Navigate to the Frontend Directory
After cloning the repository, navigate into the frontend folder: `cd frontend`
3. Install Project Dependencies
Now, install the project dependencies using npm. This will download all required packages and modules for the frontend: `npm install`
4. Run the Development Server
Once all dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running: `npm run dev`
This will start the development server and serve the project locally: `http://localhost:5173/`

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
